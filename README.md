## BAPI Demo - Alvin van der Kuech

- git clone repo
- yarn install

This demo uses jsonplaceholder as a fake api. This is to demonstrate
the use of an api with react.

The fake api doesn't provide actual Broadway Show data, so other than the title the rest of the data is somewhat hard coded to meet the "response" requirements. The api actually get's fake titles from the jsonplaceholder server.
